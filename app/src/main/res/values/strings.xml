        First of all, if you haven\'t read Leaving Earth rulebook, go do it now and then come back
        here. Basically this application is a digital version of the mission tables illustrated in
        the rulebook, but with some nice automations to help you.\n
        As the first thing, you want to create a mission, from <b>\"Command Center\"</b> view
        using the floating button. Then choose a mission name, it can either be something that reminds
        what the goal is, like <b>\"Man to Moon\"</b> or some fancy and secret name if you fear other space
        agencies espionage, like <b>\"Seeliger Effect\"</b>. You\'ll see some information about the mission,
        the most important one is the total cost that will be auto-calculated for you.\n
        Now the next step is to add mission stages, just like the rulebook explains, in reverse order.
        This will make mission planning easier.
